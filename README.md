# PKGFT-CAUDA
Prior knowledge-guided and unsupervised domain adaptation enhanced fine-tuning for electroencephalogram classification
Current Status: We have uploaded the complete LaBraM code, with our FT+DA modifications placed in the "our" subdirectory. While all necessary components are included, the code has not yet been fully organized for ease of use.
How to Use: Simply replace the corresponding files in the original LaBraM codebase with our modified versions in the "our" folder to apply our method. The original LaBraM repository (including model weights) is available at https://github.com/935963004/LaBraM.
Next Steps: We will further organize and refine the uploaded code to facilitate easy reproduction of our results.
